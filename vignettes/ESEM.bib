	abstract = {Exploratory factor analysis (EFA) is a frequently used multivariate analysis technique in statistics. Jennrich and Sampson (1966) solved a significant EFA factor loading matrix rotation problem by deriving the direct Quartimin rotation. Jennrich was also the first to develop standard errors for rotated solutions, although these have still not made their way into most statistical software programs. This is perhaps because Jennrich's achievements were partly overshadowed by the subsequent development of confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) by Jöreskog (1969). The strict requirement of zero cross-loadings in CFA, however, often does not fit the data well and has led to a tendency to rely on extensive model modification to find a well-fitting model. In such cases, searching for a well-fitting measurement model may be better carried out by EFA (Browne, 2001). Furthermore, misspecification of zero loadings usually leads to distorted factors with over-estimated factor correlations and subsequent distorted structural relations. This article describes an EFA-SEM (ESEM) approach, where in addition to or instead of a CFA measurement model, an EFA measurement model with rotations can be used in a structural equation model. The ESEM approach has recently been implemented in the Mplus program. ESEM gives access to all the usual SEM parameters and the loading rotation gives a transformation of structural coefficients as well. Standard errors and overall tests of model fit are obtained. Geomin and Target rotations are discussed. Examples of ESEM models include multiple-group EFA with measurement and structural invariance testing, test–retest (longitudinal) EFA, EFA with covariates and direct effects, and EFA with correlated residuals. Testing strategies with sequences of EFA and CFA models are discussed. Simulated and real data are used to illustrate the points.},

	abstract = {Exploratory factor analysis (EFA) and confirmatory factor analysis (CFA), path analysis, and structural equation modeling (SEM) have long histories in clinical research. Although CFA has largely superseded EFA, CFAs of multidimensional constructs typically fail to meet standards of good measurement: goodness of fit, measurement invariance, lack of differential item functioning, and well-differentiated factors in support of discriminant validity. Part of the problem is undue reliance on overly restrictive CFAs in which each item loads on only one factor. Exploratory SEM (ESEM), an overarching integration of the best aspects of CFA/SEM and traditional EFA, provides confirmatory tests of a priori factor structures, relations between latent factors and multigroup/multioccasion tests of full (mean structure) measurement invariance. It incorporates all combinations of CFA factors, ESEM factors, covariates, grouping/multiple-indicator multiple-cause (MIMIC) variables, latent growth, and complex structures that typically have required CFA/SEM. ESEM has broad applicability to clinical studies that are not appropriately addressed either by traditional EFA or CFA/SEM.},

	abstract = {Exploratory structural equation modeling (ESEM) is an integration of exploratory factor analysis (EFA) within the global GSEM framework. Thus, ESEM combines the benefits associated with EFA's flexibility along with access to typical CFA/SEM parameters and statistical advances: standard errors; goodness of fit statistics; comparisons of competing models through tests of statistical significance and fit indices; inclusion of correlated uniquenesses; inclusion of both CFA and EFA factors based on the same, different, or overlapping sets of items; estimation of method effects; multiple indicators multiple causes models (MIMIC) models; and tests of multiple group and longitudinal invariance. In this chapter, we compared factor solutions generated from ESEM relative to ICM-CFA. Guided by the taxonomy of invariance models, we also demonstrated the utility of ESEM for tests of multiple-group and longitudinal tests of measurement invariance based on the Marsh et al. (2009, 2010) 13-model taxonomy, which can also be applied in traditional ICM-CFA studies. However, to the extent that the ESEM solution provides an acceptable fit to the data and the CFA solution does not, then the appropriateness of the taxonomy for CFA models is dubious. In this respect we present the ESEM as a viable alterative to CFA, but do not argue that it should replace CFA. Still, ESEM should generally be preferred to ICM-CFA when the factors are appropriately identified by ESEM, the goodness of fit is meaningfully better than for ICM-CFA, and factor correlations are meaningfully smaller than for ICM-CFA. Furthermore, based on Marsh's (2007; Marsh et al., 2005) suggestion that almost no multidimensional psychological instruments widely used in practice provides an acceptable fit in relation to an a priori ICM-CFA structure, we suspect that ESEM is likely to generate better factorial solutions. In this situation, we suggest that advanced statistical strategies such as multi-group tests of measurement invariance, MIMIC models, and even latent growth models in many applications are more appropriately conducted with an ESEM approach than with a traditional ICM-CFA approach. To illustrate this point, we also showed that autoregressive cross lagged models and change-score based longitudinal mediation models could be estimated in ESEM, or within the complementary EWC method. While we believe that the results of existing research provide considerable support to ESEM, there have been only few large-scale applications of ESEM in applied research settings. Clearly there is need for further research based on the application of ESEM to other areas in psychology, education, and the social sciences more generally. Based on results from existing ESEM research we recommend that the psychometric evaluation of psychological assessment instruments should routinely apply ESEM and juxtapose the results with corresponding CFA models that are traditionally used.
